# Mission to Mars

### Project Brief

The purpose of this assignment was to add polish to the web app that was created in this week's module using Chrome Developer Tools (to identify HTML components), BeautifulSoup and Slinter (to automate the scrape) and Mongo to store the data. Using these tools, full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of those images were scraped, stored and displayed. After this process was completed, tweaks were made to the index.html document to make the webpage mobile-responsive and more aesthetically pleasing.
